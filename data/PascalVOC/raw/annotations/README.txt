This is a beta release of the keypoint annotations and some foreground annotations of train+val examples from PASCAL 2011

Please note that the annotations for the person category of 2010 and 2011 images are not curated and therefore are of lower quality. To train the poselets detector for person we used the H3D images, as well as the train09 images (but not the val09 images, which are curated)

If you use this dataset please cite our PAMI submission as follows:

@InProceedings{PoseletsPAMI,
  author       = "Lubomir Bourdev and Subhransu Maji and Jitendra Malik",
  title        = "Detection, Attribute Classification and Action Recognition of People using Poselets (in submission)",
  booktitle    = {IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence},
}

If you have questions please email lubomir.bourdev@gmail.com

Good luck with your projects!
